# Midterm Retail Sales Project

## Business Problem
Analyze retail sales to identify which product categories and regions generated the highest revenue in the past 12 months.

- Relationships defined via foreign keys
- ER diagram included as ER_diagram.png

## Setup Instructions
1. Create the database schema by running `schema.sql`.
2. Load sample data by running `sample_data.sql`.
3. Create the view using the provided SQL.
